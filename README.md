# On Screen RGB Detector
On-Screen RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Detector is an innovative approach that enables on-screen colour detection with few hand gestures.

However, it is sometimes essential for you to know the picture's RGB values or anything else, then you're in the right place. <br/>
It measures the RGB colour value of **every single pixel** present on your computer screen **live** by following the position of cursor/mouse pointer with pixel coordinates.<br/>

Application is built using Python programing language (3.10) and Tkinter framework for Graphical User Interface (GUI).


# Working ðŸ’»

**R, G, B = 255, 255, 255**  ***(Absolute white)***</br>

**R, G, B =    0,    0,    0**  ***(Absolute black)***</br>

Respectively for all colors :
* R or G or B is (255)</br>
Represent **Maximum** amount of that color</br>

* R or G or B is (  0)</br>
 Represent **Minimum** amount of that color</br>


# Features
