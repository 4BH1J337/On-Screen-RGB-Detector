</br>
On-Screen RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Detector is an innovative approach that enables on-screen colour detection with few hand gestures.
Sometimes you need to know the RGB value of a picture or anything else, then you are in the right place.
The On Screen RGB Detector measures the RGB color value of **every single pixel** on your computer screen **live** by following the cursor/mouse pointer position along with the pixel coordinates.</br>
 
Application is built using Python programing language (3.10) and Tkinter framework for Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Working ‚öôÔ∏è

**R, G, B = 255, 255, 255**  ***(Absolute white)***</br>

**R, G, B =    0,    0,    0**  ***(Absolute black)***</br>

Respectively for all colors :
* R or G or B is (255)</br>
Represent **Maximum** amount of that color</br>

* R or G or B is (  0)</br>
 Represent **Minimum** amount of that color</br>


## Features
* Measurement of **RGB** colours by following the position of cursor/mouse pointer with pixel coordinate live
* Readings are captured by keystrokes for user convenience
* RGB values are automatically copied to clipboard
</br>
