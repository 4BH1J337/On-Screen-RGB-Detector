# On Screen RGB Detector
On-Screen RGB (red, blue, green) Detector is an innovative approach that enables on-screen colour detection with few hand gestures.

However, it is sometimes essential for you to know the picture's RGB values or anything else, then you're in the right place. <br/>
It measures the RGB colour value of every single pixel present on your computer screen by following the position cursor/mouse pointer with pixel coordinates.<br/>

The RGB values are measured every 3 seconds meanwhile you can stop the measurement and note down the readings.<br/>

Application is built using Python programing language (3.10) and Tkinter framework for Graphical User Interface (GUI).

 Two buttons were embedded <br/>
* (i) To **start** the programme or to show RGB values with coordinates.<br/>
* (ii) To **stop** the programme temporarily, since the measurement is taken every 3 seconds, so user can        note down the readings of any specific pixel.
